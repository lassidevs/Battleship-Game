## Javascript battleship
This is a modified version of the traditional battleship game. Instead of placing the ships yourself, the game randomly generates ship locations on start. 

The goal is to sink the computer's ships in the fewest number of guesses. After sinking all three battleships, the game displays your rating based on how many guesses it took.
